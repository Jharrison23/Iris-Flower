Simple Machine Learning Classification algorithm to identify the type of flower
based off of the features Sepal Length and Width, and Petal Length and Width

Written by James Harrison following along with a google researcher tutorial

Data set obtained from the URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

we will import the data set to train our classifier and then use that classifier
to predict what species of flower we have if we get a new flower we havent seen before

After we will print the decision tree classifier used for the classification into a PDF
